1. # Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
We divided the picture of Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' into 49*49 squares. I am mainly responsible for the task of filling the small grids in the group code, so I mainly use the fillGrid() method. After finishing my part, I changed background(225) to background(255). And changed the strokeWeight of the square to 0.
2. # Which did you choose to drive your individual code: audio, interaction, Perlin noise or time.
I choose interaction to drive my individual code.
